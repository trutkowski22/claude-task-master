### Task: CLI Component Analysis

#### LLM Prompt: CLI Component Mapping
```
# CLI Component Analysis Task

## Context
You are helping migrate Claude Task Master from a hybrid MCP+CLI system to a pure cloud-hosted MCP server. The first critical step is performing comprehensive analysis to identify all CLI-specific components for safe removal.

## Task Objective
Conduct thorough analysis of the entire codebase using mermaid diagrams to identify all CLI-specific components, shared components, and MCP-only components to create a safe CLI removal strategy.

## Analysis Scope
Use the comprehensive mermaid diagram analysis to examine:
- **MCP Interface Layer**: 32 MCP tools (should be CLI-independent)
- **Core Implementation Layer**: 31 direct functions (check for CLI dependencies)
- **Task Manager Layer**: 25 business logic files (should be CLI-independent)
- **Shared Infrastructure Layer**: 91+ files (identify CLI vs MCP usage)

## Methodology
1. **Mermaid Diagram Analysis**: Use existing architectural diagrams as authoritative source
2. **Import Statement Review**: Parse all import dependencies from diagrams
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Create comprehensive dependency graph
4. **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Identify CLI vs MCP usage patterns
5. **Safe Removal Planning**: Design elimination strategy with zero MCP impact

## Component Categories to Identify
1. **CLI-Only Components**: Files used exclusively by CLI interface
   - CLI entry points and command handlers
   - CLI-specific utilities and formatters
   - CLI configuration and argument parsing

2. **MCP-Only Components**: Files used exclusively by MCP server
   - MCP tool implementations
   - MCP-specific utilities and formatters
   - MCP server configuration

3. **Shared Components**: Files used by both CLI and MCP
   - Core business logic utilities
   - Data validation functions
   - File I/O operations (if used by both)

4. **Hybrid Components**: Files containing both CLI and MCP functionality
   - Mixed utility files
   - Shared configuration files
   - Common error handling

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Component Inventory**: Complete categorization of all 200+ files
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Comprehensive dependency mapping
3. **CLI Removal Plan**: Safe elimination strategy
4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential impacts and mitigation strategies
5. **Testing Strategy**: Validation approach for CLI removal

## Success Criteria

3. **config files**: Shared configuration with CLI-specific sections

## Refactoring Strategy
1. **Backup Creation**: Create backup of all hybrid files
2. **Function Analysis**: Identify which functions are used by CLI vs MCP
3. **Clean Separation**: Extract shared business logic into pure functions
4. **CLI Isolation**: Move CLI-specific code to CLI-only modules
5. **Interface Preservation**: Maintain existing MCP interfaces

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create backup**: `cp scripts/modules/task-manager.js scripts/modules/task-manager.js.backup`
2. **Remove CLI imports**: Delete terminal library imports
3. **Remove CLI-specific code paths**: Remove console output formatting
4. **Preserve export functions**: Keep all business logic exports intact
5. **Test MCP functionality**: Validate MCP server after each change

## Validation Requirements
